# A simple discord bot made with DSharpPlus ðŸ¤–

**This is a really simple Discord bot that I made for fun by studying the DSharpPlus documentation.
The bot doesn't have a purpose, but you can clone the project and extend it / change it as much as you like ðŸ˜€**

## TODO:
**In the future I will most likely extend the bot a bit and play around with it when I have time. Some features that could be added:**

- **Command descriptions**
- **Commands with arguments**
- **Slash commands**
- **Polls**
- **Music commands**
- **Small trivia games**
